Project Tasks & Features:

1. **City Selection:** The system allows users to select from cities with a population of over 100,000. This feature enables the tool to provide detailed weather updates for a diverse range of locations.
2. **City List Management:** Users have the ability to manage their selected cities list, adding new cities or removing existing ones, to ensure they receive the most relevant weather updates.
3. **Data Sorting:** The tool offers flexible sorting options. Users can sort the weather data based on various parameters to customize their viewing and analysis experience.
4. **City Highlighting:** With the aid of a right-click, users can highlight a city. This feature enhances the user interaction with the list of cities and can be used to mark a city of particular interest.
5. **Data Caching:** To provide a smooth user experience, our system incorporates data caching. This feature reduces server load and enhances the speed and efficiency of the system.

Target Audience: This project is a test assignment, which would be evaluated by technical evaluators.

Unique Features: The project leverages the React-Redux-Toolkit-Persist stack for robust data handling and state management. Axios is used for making API requests, and React-Select is employed for implementing the city selection feature.
